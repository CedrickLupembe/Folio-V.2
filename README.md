# Portfolio - V2 ðŸš€ðŸ”¥


The second iteration of my unfinished portfolio but done ðŸ˜‚ built with __html__, __css__, __vanilla js__ and hosted with __Vercel__



### Forking

Yeah sure! You can use my code and design on your site! But of course, with __attribution__. I have put in a lot of effort to build this ground up.

I don't want to use harsh words, but *__plagiarism is bad__*. Please empathize my situation and give me proper credits for my work.

### Design

You don't have to give me credits for that, unless you're copying most of them. I myself drew all design inspirations from [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/).

## Development

### Get started:


1. You need node js (v14+ recommended) installed and setup in your machine to get started. Choose the one appropriate for you and install: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
1. Fork the repository.
1. Clone/ download your fork to your local machine.

*And that all !!!*
 

## What I used

* `html5` for structure
* `css3` for styling
* `Font Awesome` for Icons
* `Calibre` the main font for Typography
* `SF Mono Regular` the second font 
* `Aos` for animation on scroll
